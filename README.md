You would use this script if you wanted to reduce a bitcoin public key from say a 130 bit range down to a 120 bit range.
This is an oldie but goodie script that doesn't use outside bitcoin curve/libraries so hopefully you can follow and understand what the script is doing.
I posted this to help show some people how it works. There are comments in the script where I am taking a 47 bit key down to a 42 bit range.
More to follow...
